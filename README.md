Localization for Parzi's Star Wars Mod

## Steps to Help Translate
1. If a localization file (i.e. `en_US.lang` for American English) already exists, create a fork of the repository and edit the file. **Proceed to step 3.**
2. If a localization file does **NOT** already exist, create a fork of the repository and create a new file with a [filename that corresponds to your language](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Language). The file name *must* be the **locale code** of your language, plus `.lang` at the end. 
3. Create a pull request back to this repository
4. We will either accept or, under extreme circumstances, reject your pull request
5. The new language additions will appear in the next version of the mod
